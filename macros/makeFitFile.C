// Example of how to create an input data file for Laura++ to fit
//
// This example assumes that the input file contains the branches "m13" and
// "m23", which correspond to m_D0barpi+ and m_D0barpi-, respectively.
// Any additional variables that you wish to include in the fit or simply for
// information can be trivially added by including lines such as the following
// in the appropriate place:
//
// Double_t myVar(0.0);
// ...
// inputTree->SetBranchAddress("myVar",&myVar);
// ...
// outputTree->Branch("myVar",&myVar,"myVar/D");
//
// Square DP co-ordinates can also be included by changing the 5th argument of
// the LauDaughters ctor to kTRUE and uncommenting the appropriate lines.
