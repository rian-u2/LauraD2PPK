28th January 2014 Daniel Craik

* Improved out-of-range efficiency warnings in LauEffModel and supressed excessive errors
* Modified LauIsobarDynamics to allow LASS parameters to be configured for LauLASSBWRes and
  LauLASSNRRes

27th January 2014 Daniel Craik

* Added spline interpolation to DP backgrounds
  - Added Lau2DSplineDPPdf which uses a spline to model a normalised PDF across a DP
  - Added pABC, Lau2DAbsDPPdf, for Lau2DHistDPPdf and Lau2DSplineDPPdf and moved common 
    code in Lau2DHistDPPdf and Lau2DSplineDPPdf into ABC Lau2DAbsHistDPPdf
  - LauBkgndModel, modified to use Lau2DAbsDPPdf instead of Lau2DHistDPPdf
  - setBkgndSpline method added to LauBkgndDPModel to allow use of splines

16th January 2014 Thomas Latham

* Add LauRealImagCPCoeffSet, which provides an (x,y), (xbar,ybar) way of
  parametrising the complex coefficients.
* Try to improve timing in the *CoeffSet classes by making the complex coeffs
  into member variables.

20th December 2013 Daniel Craik

* Added Lau2DCubicSpline which provides cubic spline interpolation of a histogram
  - Added Lau2DSplineDP which uses a spline to model variation across a DP (eg efficiency)
  - Added pABC, Lau2DAbsDP, for Lau2DHistDP and Lau2DSplineDP and moved common code 
    in Lau2DHistDP and Lau2DSplineDP into ABC Lau2DAbsHistDP
  - LauEffModel, LauDPDepSumPdf and LauDPDepMapPdf modified to use Lau2DAbsDP instead of 
    Lau2DHistDP
  - setEffSpline method added to LauEffModel and useSpline flag added to constructor for 
    LauDPDepSumPdf to allow use of splines

5th December 2013 Thomas Latham

* Fix small bug in GenFitKpipi example where background asymmetry parameter had
  its limits the wrong way around

4th December 2013 Daniel Craik

* Updated 2D chi-squared code to use adaptive binning.

3rd December 2013 Thomas Latham

* Generalise the Makefile in the examples directory
  - results in minor changes to the names of 3 of the binaries

29th November 2013 Thomas Latham

* Fixed bug in ResultsExtractor where the output file was not written

22nd November 2013 Thomas Latham

* Fixed bug in LauCPFitModel where values of q = -1 extra PDFs
  were used regardless of the event charge.

20th November 2013 Mark Whitehead

* Changed convention for the barrier factors, swapping from p* to p.
  This seems to give more physically reasonable results.
  The files updated are:
  - src/LauGounarisSakuraiRes.cc
  - src/LauRelBreitWignerRes.cc

18th October 2013 Thomas Latham

* Fix dependency problem in Makefile

8th October 2013 Thomas Latham

* Some fixes to yield implementation
* Minor bug fix in DP background histogram class

7th October 2013 Mark Whitehead

* Update to accept the yields and yield asymmetries as LauParameters.
  All examples have been updated to reflect this change.
  This updated the following files:
  - inc/LauCPFitModel.hh
  - inc/LauSimpleFitModel.hh
  - inc/LauAbsFitModel.hh
  - src/LauCPFitModel.cc
  - src/LauSimpleFitModel.cc

* Addition of the following particles to src/LauResonanceMaker.cc
  Ds*+-, Ds0*(2317)+-, Ds2*(2573)+-, Ds1*(2700)+- and Bs*0

13th September 2013 Thomas Latham

* Initial import of the package into HEPforge
