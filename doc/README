			Introduction
			------------

This package is a C++ development of LAURA, the FORTRAN "Likelihood Analysis
Unofficial RooFitDalitz Alternative" code written by Paul Harrison for
performing Dalitz plot analyses of 3-body decays of B mesons at BaBar.
This C++ version was originally developed by John Back and is now mainly
developed by Tom Latham with continuting contributions from John Back and
others.

			Building the Code
			-----------------

The package depends only on ROOT.  Before building the code, it is necessary
that either the ROOTSYS environment variable be set or that the root-config
program be in the PATH.

To build the shared library:

cd Laura++
make

A shared library will be created in the lib sub-directory:

lib/libLaura++.so

(It has been reported that when compiling on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with gcc 5.4.0
the build will fail due to, apparently spurious, "variable defined but not
used" errors related to the constants defined in the LauConstants.hh header
file. The workaround is to add the option -Wno-error=unused-variable to the
CXXFLAGS variable in the Makefile.)


			Examples and Documentation
			--------------------------

Example code is included in the examples directory.

To build the example code:
cd examples
make

(On MacOSX it is currently necessary to also do:
ln -s ../lib .
in order to successfully run the examples.
We hope to have a solution to avoid this step soon.)

To build the online doxygen documentation just run doxygen in the top level
Laura++ directory and then load the index.html file found in doxygen/html.

A quick-start guide and further documentation are being worked on.

Please contact Tom Latham (laura@projects.hepforge.org) with any questions.
