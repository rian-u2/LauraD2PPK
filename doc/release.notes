8th September 2015 Mark Whitehead

* Add the ability to modify the error of parameters via the CoeffSet
  - setParameterError added to LauAbsCoeffSet
* Tweak the handling of initial error values passed to MINUIT (to determine initial step size) in LauMinuit


7th September 2015 Mark Whitehead

* Add the ability to Gaussian constrain parameters via the CoeffSet
  - addGaussianConstraint added to LauAbsCoeffSet

12th June 2015 Thomas Latham

* Modifications to Belle-style nonresonant models
  - LauBelleNR modified to use pure Legendre polynomials of cos(theta) in the spin term (i.e. to remove the q*p factors)
  - New form added to LauBelleSymNR (LauAbsResonance::BelleSymNRNoInter) that removes the interference term between the two DP halves
  - The new form also works with non-zero spin (warning added if non-zero spin specified for BelleSymNR and TaylorNR)

8th June 2015 Thomas Latham

* Further work on the blinding mechanism:
  - New method added LauParameter::blindParameter that activates the blinding.
  - The rest of the framework updated to use another new method LauParameter::unblindedValue in all likelihood calculations etc.
  - Example GenFitNoDP updated to include lines to optionally blind the yield parameters.

29th May 2015 Daniel Craik

* Added LauBlind class for blinding and unblinding a value with an offset based on a blinding string

26th May 2015 Daniel Craik

* Stopped LauCPFitModel passing fixed signal/background yields or 
  asymmetries to Minuit to avoid hitting limit of 101 fixed parameters

22nd April 2015 Daniel Craik

* Updated MIPW classes to use Lau1DCubicSpline

19th April 2015 Daniel Craik

26th March 2015 Thomas Latham

* Reworked MIPW code into abstract base class and derived classes
  to allow different representations of the amplitude at each knot

31st December 2015 Daniel Craik

* Added unbinned goodness of fit tests to examples

12th January 2015 Daniel Craik

* Calculate effective masses for virtual resonances above the upper kinematic limit

10th December 2014 Daniel Craik

* Added coefficient sets to extract gamma from a simultaneous fit to CP and nonCP final states, 
  such as the B0->D_CP K pi and B0->D0bar K pi Dalitz plots, as proposed in Phys. Rev. D79, 051301 (2009)
  - LauPolarGammaCPCoeffSet uses the CP parameters r, delta and gamma directly
  - LauRealImagGammaCPCoeffSet parameterises CPV as X_CP+/- and Y_CP+/-
  - LauCartesianGammaCPCoeffSet parameterises CPV as X_CP, Y_CP DeltaX_CP DeltaY_CP
  - Fixed CP parameters are not passed to the fitter so the same coefficient sets can be used for both the 
    CP and nonCP Dalitz plots
  - LauPolarGammaCPCoeffSet allows for a single gamma parameter to be shared between multiple resonances
  - LauAbsCoeffSet::adjustName made virtual to allow global variables such as gamma to not receive a prefix

24th October 2014 Thomas Latham

* Fixed bug in floating of Blatt-Weisskopf barrier radii
  - The values at the pole mass were not being updated when the radii changed

21st October 2014 Daniel Craik

* Fixed bug in LauIsobarDynamics where multiple incoherent amplitudes led to nonsensical fit fractions

17th October 2014 John Back

* Added the ability to calculate the transition amplitude matrix T in LauKMatrixPropagator,
  as well as a few other minor speed-up changes and code checks. Example/PlotKMatrixTAmp.cc
  can be used to check the T amplitude variation, phase shift and inelasticity, for a given 
  K matrix channel, as a function of the invariant mass squared variable s

15th October 2014 Thomas Latham

* Add methods to LauIsobarDynamics to make the integration binning more tunable by the user:
  - setNarrowResonanceThreshold - modify the value below which a resonance is considered to be narrow (defaults to 0.02 GeV/c2)
  - setIntegralBinningFactor - modify the factor by which the narrow resonance width is divided to obtain the bin size (defaults to 100)
* Print warning messages if the memory usage is likely to be very large

10th October 2014 Thomas Latham

* Add new method to LauResonanceMaker to set whether the radius of a given Blatt-Weisskopf category should be fixed of floated
* Modify the methods of LauResonanceMaker to set the radius value and whether it should be floated so that they work before and after the resonances have been created

9th October 2014 John Back

* Corrected the eta-eta' and 4pi phase space factors in LauKMatrixPropagator,
  which is used for the K-matrix amplitude:
  - calcEtaEtaPRho() does not include the mass difference term m_eta - m_eta'
    following the recommendation in hep-ph/0204328 and from advice from M Pennington
  - calcFourPiRho() incorporates a better parameterisation of the double integral of Eq 4 in
    hep-ph/0204328 which avoids the exponential increase for small values of s (~< 0.1)
  - More detailed comments are provided in the above two functions to explain what is
    going on and the reason for the choices made

6th October 2014 Thomas Latham

* Implement the mechanism for floating Blatt-Weisskopf barrier factor radius parameters

30th September 2014 Thomas Latham

* Fix issue in the checks on toy MC generation validity
  - in the case of exceeding max iterations it was possible to enter an infinite loop
  - the checks now detect all three possible states:
    - aSqMaxSet_ is too low (generation is biased) => increase aSqMaxSet_ value
    - aSqMaxSet_ is too high => reduce aSqMaxSet_ value to improve efficiency
    - aSqMaxSet_ is high (causing low efficiency) but cannot be lowered without biasing => increase iterationsMax_ limit
* Update resonance parameter in LauResonanceMaker to match PDG 2014
* Modify behaviour when TTree objects are saved into files to avoid having multiple cycle numbers present

29th September 2014 Daniel Craik

* Add support for incoherent resonances in the signal model
  - LauIsobarDynamics updated to include incoherent terms
  - ABC for incoherent resonances, LauAbsIncohRes, added deriving from LauAbsResonance
  - LauGaussIncohRes added to implement a Gaussian incoherent resonance, deriving from LauAbsIncohRes
  - Small changes to various other classes to enable incoherent terms
* Fixed small bug in LauMagPhaseCoeffSet which could hang if phase is exactly pi or -pi
* Added charged version of the BelleNR resonances to LauResonanceMaker
* Updated parameters in LauConstants to match PDG 2014

14th July 2014 Thomas Latham

* Add intial support for fully-symmetric final states such as B0 -> KS KS KS
  - Performs the symmetrisation of the signal model
  - Background (and efficiency) histogram classes need some work if the user wants to provide folded histograms

8th July 2014 Daniel Craik

* Add class for model-independent partial wave
  - Uses splines to produce a smooth amplitude from a set of magnitude and phase values at given invariant masses
  - The individual magnitudes and phases can be floated in the fit

16th June 2014 Thomas Latham

* Allow floating of resonance parameters in simultaneous fits

13th June 2014 Thomas Latham

* Fix bug in LauResonanceInfo cloning method, where the width parameter was given a clone of the mass

10th June 2014 Thomas Latham

* Add new function to allow sharing of resonance parameters between components that are not charged conjugates, e.g. LASS_BW and LASS_NR

9th June 2014 Thomas Latham and Daniel Craik

* Fix bug in the new integration scheme
  - Was not accounting for cases where several resonances share a floating parameter
  - Meant that the integrals and caches for that resonance were not being updated
* Introduce a change in the implementation of the helicity flip for neutral parent decays
  - Prior to this change the helicity was flipped for any neutral resonance in the decay of a neutral particle.
  - Now the flip no longer occurs in flavour-specific decays (such as Bs0 -> D0bar K- pi+ or B0 -> K+ pi- pi0) since it is only required in flavour-conjugate modes (such as B0 -> KS pi+ pi-).
  - This does not affect any physical results but it does contribute a pi phase flip to some odd-spin resonances (for example K*(892)0 in Bs0->D0barKpi).
  - Therefore results are not necessarily comparable between fits run before and after this changeset.
  - This change will first be released in v3r0.

  - LauIsobarDynamics still knows about Blatt-Weisskopf factors - better to only need to set this once
  - Update GenFit3pi example to demonstrate mechanism

22nd April 2014 Thomas Latham

* Allow Gaussian constraints to be added in simultaneous fitting
  - constraints will be ignored by the slaves
  - those added directly to fit parameters will be propogated to the master and handled there
  - those on combinations of parameters should be added in the master process

22nd April 2014 Mark Whitehead
