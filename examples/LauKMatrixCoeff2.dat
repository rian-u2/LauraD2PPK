# File for K-pi K-matrix S-wave amplitude. Values are guesses - need updating.
# First, define the indices of the phase-space channels defined by
# the LauKMatrixPropagator::KMatrixChannel enum
Channels 6 7 8
# Next, define the bare pole masses and coupling constants g^(alpha)_j.
# First int = alpha (pole index number), 2nd number = pole mass (GeV/c^2), while
# the other numbers are constants for each channel j = 1 to N for the given pole
Pole 1 1.235 1.739 1.0 0.112
Pole 2 1.810 0.454 0.8 0.391
Pole 3 1.947 0.493 0.3 -0.368
# Next, define the scattering f_{ij} constants. Here, the first integer is
# the scattering channel index, while the other numbers = f_{ij}, j = 1 to N
Scatt 1 0.880 0.430 0.170
# Finally, define the "Alder-zero constants"
# mSq0 s0Scatt s0Prod sA sA0
