			Introduction
			------------

This package is a C++ development of LAURA, the FORTRAN "Likelihood Analysis
Unofficial RooFitDalitz Alternative" code written by Paul Harrison for
performing Dalitz plot analyses of 3-body decays of B mesons at BaBar.
This C++ version was originally developed by John Back and is now mainly
developed by Tom Latham with continuting contributions from John Back and
others.

			Building the Code
			-----------------

The package depends only on ROOT.  Before building the code, it is necessary
that either the ROOTSYS environment variable be set or that the root-config
program be in the PATH.

To build the shared library:

cd Laura++
make

A shared library will be created in the lib sub-directory:

lib/libLaura++.so


			Examples and Documentation
			--------------------------

Example code is included in the examples directory.

To build the example code:
cd examples
make

To build the online doxygen documentation just run doxygen in the top level
Laura++ directory and then load the index.html file found in doxygen/html.

A quick-start guide and further documentation are being worked on.

Please contact Tom Latham (laura@projects.hepforge.org) with any questions.
