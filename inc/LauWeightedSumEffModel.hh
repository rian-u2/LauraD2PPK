/*! \class LauWeightedSumEffModel
    \brief Class that implements the efficiency description across the signal Dalitz plot.

    Class that defines the efficiency model variation across the signal Dalitz plot.
    The phase space acceptance is determined from a weighted sum of LauAbsEffModel objects. 
    This is useful for samples that contain two different categories of signal with different efficiencies.
    The efficiency variation is defined in terms of x = m_13^2, y = m_23^2 for the Dalitz plot (default) 
    or x = m', y = theta' for the square Dalitz plot
