/*! \class LauSPlot
    \brief Class for defining the SPlot technique

    Class for defining the SPlot technique based on TSplot from ROOT by the following authors:
    Muriel Pivk, Anna Kreshuk (10/2005).
    (Original copyright notice below)

    Code extended to deal with the following two extra scenarios:
    - Extended sPlots (see appendix B of sPlot paper)
    - 2D PDFs, i.e. one PDF for 2 variables

    When performing a multidimensional fit, the sWeights are calculated
    excluding each dimension in turn and excluding none of the variables.  This
    allows sPlots of the fit variables to be made by using the weight
    calculated when that variable is excluded, while variables not in the fit
    can be plotted from the complete information.
