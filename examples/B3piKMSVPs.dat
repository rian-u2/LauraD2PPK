# File for pi-pi K-matrix S-wave amplitude.

# First, define the indices of the phase-space channels defined by
# the LauKMatrixPropagator::KMatrixChannel enum
Channels 1 2 3 4 5
# Next, define the bare pole masses and coupling constants g^(alpha)_j.
# First int = alpha (pole index number), 2nd number = pole mass (GeV/c^2), while
# the other numbers are constants for each channel j = 1 to N for the given pole
#Pole 1 0.65100 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0

#Pole 5 1.82206 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0 0.0
# Next, define the scattering f_{ij} constants. Here, the first integer is
# the scattering channel index, while the other numbers = f_{ij}, j = 1 to N
